            <li style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0;">Recover Files</li>
            <p>once the download has completed. install the setup and open it the software.</p>
            <p>when you open the software it will show you Welcome to Recuva page. click on "Next"</p>
            <p>now click on the file type that you would like to recover. if you are not sure or had multiple different type of files. and then just click on 'All Files' then click 'Next'</p>
            <img class="pics" src="images/files.png" alt="file-type">
            <p>select the file location where were the files last time you deleted them from. check on 'In a specific location' and click on the 'Browse' to select the drive or the directory of the where the files were. after selecting the path click on 'Next' to start the scan. if you are not sure or you want recover files from your entire computer. you can just simply check on the 'I'm not sure'. to scan your entire computer. but keep in mind it may takes anywhere between couple of minutes to hours to complete the scan.</p>
            <img class="pics" src="images/location.png" alt="location">
            <p>now once the scan has completed. it will show you the files you had deleted or more than that. now select the files you want to recover and click on the 'Recover'</p>
            <img class="pics" src="images/recover.png" alt="recover">
            <p>Now your Files have been successfuly recovered and stored in the same files as they were before you deleted them.</p>
            <p>If above method didn't work for you and some files were still missing. you can use the "Deep scan" method in recuva which is very effective. but also it may take a time to complete the scan depending on your hard drive perfomance</p>
