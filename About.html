      <h2 class="intro">Who are we?</h2>
      <p>The internet is evolving to its next level with the advent of AI. Unfortunately, traditional cybersecurity companies using outdated methods are no longer effective in protecting their clients from the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. As an upcoming cybersecurity company, we prioritize the use of AI and ML to provide advanced protection to our clients against cyber threats. Our current objective is to increase our online presence by publishing blogs that educate readers on enhancing system security and privacy.</p>

      <h2>things you can expect from us in future</h2>
      <p>Currently, we are limited to publishing blogs and applications. However, we plan to release a free AI chatbot that will offer in-depth cyber security education, guide users to enhance their security measures, write hacking scripts, and provide more features. If you wish to expedite the release of this chatbot, you may support us by making a donation through our <a href="\donate.html">donate page</a>. We are committed to providing a seamless user experience without cluttering the browser with ads, and our startup relies entirely on donations. </p>
