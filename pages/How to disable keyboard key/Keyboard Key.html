        <p style="">do you have that annoying key on your keyboard that messes things up while you are working or gaming. key like ContextMenu, extra window key on the right side of your keyboard or any other useless key that you don't need. well its not that hard to disable them... <br> <br>just follow these first 2 steps and you got this! let's begin </p>

        <div class="howto">

            <li style="width: 25%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0;">Download KeyTweak</li>
            <p>KeyTweak is a simple software that allows users to redefine their keyboard input signals. we can use this software to disable(or enable if it's disabled) keys.</p>
            <p>go to <a style="color: orange;" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/keytweak/" target="_blank" >this website</a> to download KeyTweak software. </p>
            <p>click on the "DOWNLOAD NOW" to download the software (this software works on any windows system including windows 10 and 11)</p>
            <img class="pics" src="images\Download_page.PNG" alt="">
            <p>after downloading the software go to your download folder then click on KeyTweak_install to install it. once the installation is complete we can procced to the next step</p>

            <hr style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0;">
            <li style="width: 50%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0;">How to disable the key using KeyTweak</li>
            <p>after completing the installation go on the path where you have installed it. <br>if you don't know where you have installed it then by default it gets installed on "C:\Program Files". </p>
            <p>when you open the software it will software bunch of options. forget about others we will just focus on this part of the software: </p>
            <img class="pics" src="images\KeyTweak.png" alt="">
            <p>now select the key from the graphical keyboard that you want to disable. i know those are just numbers on that keyboard. but if you hover of the certain keys the software will so you which key it is through it's name. <br>in my case it's context menu key on my keyboard which annoys me while playing game or coding. <br>context menu is on 64 number on this graphical interface keyboard. </p>
            <img class="pics" src="images\ContextMenu.png" alt="">
            <p>once you have selected your key. click on the 'Disable Key' from the bottom. and then click on 'Apply'</p>
            <img class="pics" src="images\Disable_key.png" alt="">
            <p>once you click the apply it will ask you to restart your computer. after the restart your key will be disabled. <br> if you want to disable more than one key then you'll have to follow this entire step again for each key. <br>now let's see how to enable the key we have disabled. </p>

            <li>Enable the disabled Key</li>
            <p>just do the same thing as you did to disable the key. select the key you had disabled that you want to enable back. now the software will show you "Enable" instead of "disable". click on it and then click Apply. it will ask for restart the computer. after the restart your key will be enabled" <br> however there is no other known way to me to enable the key without this software. expect messing with the registry ofcourse. the good thing is you can remove/uninstall this software once the key has disabled. and reinstall whenever you want to re-enable the key. </p>
