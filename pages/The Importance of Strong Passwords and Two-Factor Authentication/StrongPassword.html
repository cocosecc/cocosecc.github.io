        <ul>
          <li style="width: 70%; text-align: left; margin-left: 0;">Use a different password for each of your online accounts</li>
          <p style="margin-top:9px;">using a different password is a good way to protect your accounts from other platforms if hacker already has found the password of one of your account. in most cases hacker often tries to go use the same password on target's other account. so it is very important to use strong and different password everywhere </p>
